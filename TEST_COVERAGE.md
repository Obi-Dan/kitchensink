# Test Coverage Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the current test coverage for the Kitchensink application. The coverage has been measured using JaCoCo.

## Coverage Summary

| Package | Missed Instructions | Coverage | Missed Branches | Branches Coverage | Missed Complexity | Total Complexity | Missed Lines | Total Lines | Missed Methods | Total Methods | Missed Classes | Total Classes |
|---------|-------------------:|:--------:|----------------:|:----------------:|------------------:|:----------------:|-------------:|------------:|---------------:|:-------------:|---------------:|:-------------:|
| **Overall** | 348 of 385 | 10% | 14 of 14 | 0% | 31 | 41 | 82 | 96 | 24 | 34 | 7 | 9 |
| org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.model | 3 of 34 | 91% | 0 of 0 | n/a | 1 | 10 | 1 | 14 | 1 | 10 | 1 | 2 |
| org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.rest | 162 of 162 | 0% | 10 of 10 | 0% | 13 | 13 | 37 | 37 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 2 |
| org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.data | 88 of 88 | 0% | 0 of 0 | n/a | 8 | 8 | 18 | 18 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 2 |
| org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.controller | 66 of 66 | 0% | 4 of 4 | 0% | 6 | 6 | 20 | 20 | 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.service | 23 of 23 | 0% | 0 of 0 | n/a | 2 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

## Analysis

- **Model Package**: Has excellent coverage (91%). The `Member` class is fully covered due to our comprehensive unit tests.
- **Util Package**: Now has 33% coverage after adding a simple test for the Resources class. One method is now covered.
- **Other Packages**: Currently have 0% coverage, as these would require either:
  - Mocking dependencies (which is currently problematic with JDK 23 compatibility issues with Mockito)
  - Integration tests with a running application server

## Improvements Made

1. Added basic unit tests for the Member model class
2. Implemented validation tests for the Member model
3. Created a simple test for the Resources utility class
4. Set up JaCoCo for code coverage measurement

## Recommendations for Further Improving Coverage

To achieve 100% branch and statement coverage, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Fix Mockito Compatibility**: Resolve the compatibility issue with JDK 23 to allow proper mocking of dependencies.
2. **REST Layer**: Create unit tests for `MemberResourceRESTService` with mocked dependencies.
3. **Data Layer**: Test `MemberRepository` and `MemberListProducer` with mocked EntityManager.
4. **Service Layer**: Test `MemberRegistration` with mocked dependencies.
5. **Controller Layer**: Test `MemberController` with mocked dependencies.
6. **Util Package**: Enhance test for Resources class to cover the `produceLog` method.

## Conclusion

While the model layer has excellent coverage, and we've made progress on the utility layer, the application as a whole requires significant additional testing to reach adequate coverage levels. The current setup has demonstrated the ability to test these components, which provides a good foundation for further testing efforts.
