# Documentation of Existing Tests

## Overview

The Kitchensink application includes two main test files that cover different aspects of the application functionality. This document outlines their purpose, desired outcomes, coverage, and categorization.

## Test Files

### 1. MemberRegistrationIT.java

**Category**: Integration Testing

**Purpose**: 
This test verifies that the member registration service works correctly within a managed container environment. It tests the complete registration flow from service layer through to persistence.

**Desired Outcomes**:
- Successfully create a new Member entity
- Persist the entity to the database
- Generate a valid ID for the new member
- Complete the transaction without errors

**Coverage**:
- Tests the service layer (`MemberRegistration` class)
- Tests the entity model (`Member` class)
- Tests the persistence layer
- Tests CDI dependency injection
- Tests transaction management

**Coverage Assessment**:
Good coverage of the happy path for member registration functionality, but lacks testing of:
- Validation failures
- Duplicate email handling
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios

### 2. RemoteMemberRegistrationIT.java

**Category**: System Testing

**Purpose**: 
Tests the application's REST API endpoint for member registration from an external client perspective. This verifies that the entire system functions correctly when accessed through its HTTP interface.

**Desired Outcomes**:
- Successfully handle an HTTP POST request with member data
- Return a 200 OK status code upon successful registration
- Process the JSON payload correctly 
- Register the member in the system

**Coverage**:
- Tests the REST endpoint functionality (`MemberResourceRESTService`)
- Tests JSON handling and HTTP communication
- Tests the full request-response cycle
- Tests the integration between the REST layer and service layer

**Coverage Assessment**:
Provides good system-level validation of the API but has limitations:
- Only tests the happy path
- No tests for invalid data
- No tests for error responses
- No tests for other HTTP methods or endpoints

## Coverage Analysis

### What's Well Covered:
- The basic member registration functionality
- The persistence layer for storing members
- The REST API for creating members

### What's Missing:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Tests for validation logic
- Tests for error handling
- Tests for edge cases and boundary conditions
- Tests for other CRUD operations (read, update, delete)
- Acceptance tests based on user scenarios
- Performance or load tests

## Test Categorization

The existing tests can be categorized as follows:

1. **Unit Testing**: None
   - The application lacks isolated tests for individual classes or methods

2. **Integration Testing**: MemberRegistrationIT.java
   - Tests the integration between components within the container
   - Verifies that multiple layers work together correctly

3. **System Testing**: RemoteMemberRegistrationIT.java
   - Tests the complete application through its external interface
   - Verifies that the system as a whole functions correctly

4. **Acceptance Testing**: None
   - No tests that verify the application meets business requirements from a user perspective

## Running the Tests

The tests require:
- Maven for dependency management
- JBoss EAP or WildFly application server for the Arquillian tests
- An environment with the application deployed for the remote tests

The tests can be run using:
```
mvn test
```

For the remote tests, the server endpoint can be configured using the system property `server.host` or environment variable `SERVER_HOST`.
